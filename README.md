## About

Better FASTA Grep, or BFG for short, is a Grep-like utility for retrieving
matching sequence records from a FASTA file. Given one or more patterns and a
FASTA file, it searches the file for matching headers and or sequences and
outputs any matching headers, sequences, or both.

## Quick installation

`bfg` is provided as a single, self-contained Python script. The easiest way to
install it is via `git`:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/fethalen/bfg
```

If you don't have `git` installed, you can simply download this repository,
move into the containing directory and run it using `./bfg`. You may have to
make the script executable by typing `chmod +x bfg`, before trying to run it.

If you see yourself using this tool frequently then simply add it to your path.
